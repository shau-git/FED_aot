    "One hundred years after the appearance of the Titans, humanity receives a grim reminder of the threat that the Titans pose. Under the belief that they were safe behind the Walls, a Colossal Titan peers over the Walls and breaks the Wall. A young boy and his friend do what they can to save the boy's mother, trapped below the debris of their fallen house, but they are forced to flee when a disturbing Titan appears. The boy watches as, before his eyes, the Titan picks her up and eats her.",
    "Titans continue to kill the citizens of Shiganshina as Eren, Mikasa, and Armin escape with their lives. After an Armored Titan breaks through the inner gate, Eren vows to kill all the Titans in the world. A year after Armin's grandfather perishes in an operation to retake Wall Maria, the three children join the military as part of the 104th Cadet Corps.",
    "After a brutal introduction to their commandant Keith Sadies, the cadets learn of Eren's past and his dreams. Eren later finds difficulty training with ODM gear, though with some motivation from his new friends he is able to overcome his struggle. The commandant later reveals that his belt was somehow broken, and Eren finds no difficulty training with functional gear.",
    "In the last days of their training, Eren learns to spar with Annie as she notes the absurd system the military operates by. Eren later uses Annie's technique against Jean during an argument. After graduation, the cadets think about which military regiment they will enlist in, and Eren's speech convinces many to consider the Scouts. However, the day after graduation, the Colossal Titan suddenly appears at Trost.",
    "Eren's fight with the Colossal Titan comes to an abrupt halt when the creature vanishes without a trace. The cadets are entrusted with the defense of the city, causing many to panic or lose hope, and Mikasa worries for Eren's life. When the battle begins, Eren's squad is quickly decimated by the invading Titans. Armin is saved from the brink of death by Eren, but Eren is eaten in his place.",
    "Eren's death weighs heavily on Armin's mind while Mikasa forcefully persuades a merchant boss to allow the civilians to evacuate the district before his goods. She recalls the day six years ago when Eren saved her from bandits who killed her parents, the day she received her scarf and began considering Eren as family.",
    "Things turn bleak for the cadets when headquarters is overrun by Titans, leaving them unable to resupply before evacuation. After Mikasa learns of Eren's death, she leads a reckless charge for HQ but gets separated from the others. She nearly accepts her imminent death until she finds the will to fight, but she is miraculously saved with the arrival of a mysterious Titan that fights other Titans, a manifestation of humanity's rage.",
    "As Jean leads the cadets to the Trost HQ, the mysterious Titan is lured there by Mikasa, Armin, and Conny. The Titan fights the others outside while the cadets enact a strategy to clear out the Titans from the supply room. After resupplying, some cadets notice the mysterious Titan collapsing from exhaustion after killing the remaining Titans. Miraculously, Eren Jaeger emerges unconscious from the Titan's nape, alive and healed.",
    "The Scouts on a scouting mission beyond Wall Rose receive news of the attack on Trost, and Commander Erwin orders for an immediate retreat. Meanwhile, Eren is brought before the leaders of the Garrison to answer for his sudden Titan powers.\nEren attempts to convince the captain that he is human, but his words fall on deaf ears. When the captain orders the artillery crew to fire upon Eren, he transforms into a partial Titan to shield his friends from the blast.",
    "Eren's sudden transformation comes as a shock to both the Garrison and his fellow cadets. Armin decides to put his life on the line and argue for Eren's sake before the captain, but the man is unmoved. However, the confrontation is resolved with the arrival of Commander Pyxis, who desires to follow the plan which Armin has devised to seal the breach in Wall Rose.",
    "Commander Pyxis announces the plan to seal Wall Rose with a boulder in the city, but the soldiers and cadets are reluctant to follow. Given the dire circumstances, Pyxis convinces the troops to take the risk. Under the command of the Garrison elite squad, Eren approaches the boulder while the other soldiers distract the Titans. However, upon transforming into his Titan form, he immediately attacks Mikasa.",
    "Eren's sudden assault causes conflict among the Garrison elite squad, though Ian believes it is best to defend Eren at all costs. Meanwhile, the cadets continue to distract the Titans in the city, though Jean's ODM gear malfunctions and he is cornered. \nSeeing flares signalling failure, Armin travels to Eren and speaks to him by cutting into his Titan's nape, reminding him of his dreams to see the outside world. His willpower rekindled, Eren's Titan begins to heal its wounds.",
    "After the skirmishes between the cadets and the Titans come to a close, the soldiers of Trost see Eren carrying the boulder to the breach and defend him with their lives. Once the breach is sealed, the Scout Regiment arrives to assist in clearing out the remaining Titans.\nAfter the battle, the cadets assist in clearing out the corpses, and Jean finds Marco's body. Some time later, Eren awakens in a cell supervised by Commander Erwin and Captain Levi, who accepts him into the Scouts.",
    "Eren is brought before a military tribunal that will determine his fate as a soldier for humanity. The Military Police Regiment wishes to thoroughly investigate Eren's Titan nature before killing him to appease the people, whereas the Scout Regiment wishes to investigate and make use of Eren's Titan powers in an upcoming scouting mission. After heated debate from both sides, it is decided that Eren will be handed over to the Scouts.",
    "Eren joins the Special Operations Squad of the Scout Regiment and is taken to an old Scout base where they will prepare for the upcoming scouting mission. He meets his squadmates and learns of the Titan research performed by Section Commander Hange.\nThe next morning, the Scouts learn that Sawney and Beane, Hange's Titan test subjects, have been killed. As the Scouts wonder who is responsible, Commander Erwin asks Eren who the true enemy is.",
    "After the 104th cadets are investigated concerning the deaths of Sawney and Beane, they are presented with the choice of which regiment they will join. Commander Erwin, informing the cadets of the Scout Regiment's upcoming mission, urges for them to join their cause, and many cadets become official Scouts.\nEren later reunites with his friends and learns of Marco's death. One month later, the Scouts set out from Calaneth District on the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission.",
    "Erwin's long distance enemy scouting formation proceeds towards Shiganshina as expected until Armin encounters a Female Titan. Joining Reiner and Jean, the three confront the Titan to buy the commander time.\nReiner comes close to death in the Female's grip, but narrowly escapes with his life. Afterward, the Female Titan changes direction, heading for Eren's position in the formation.",
    "The Female Titan devastates the Scout Regiment in search for Eren, killing any soldier it comes across. Meanwhile, Commander Erwin redirects the formation into the Forest of Giant Trees.\nWhen Squad Levi enters the forest, they soon encounter the Female Titan. The squad begins to panic, asking Captain Levi for orders, though Levi seems level-headed in the dire situation.",
    "While Squad Levi flees the Female Titan in the forest, Eren thinks back to the days when Hange experimented with his Titan abilities and his squad's trust in him was tested. Placing his faith in his comrades, he agrees to follow Captain Levi's orders to advance without confronting the Titan.\nThe chase comes to an abrupt halt when the Female Titan runs right into Commander Erwin's trap, where it is caught with weaponized restraints. As the squad recovers, Levi joins the commander to discover the identity of the Female Titan.",
    "The Scouts worry over the thought of Titan spies in their midst as Commander Erwin makes attempts to extract the Female Titan's human form. However, the Female Titan uses a scream to attract nearby Titans which devour its body.\nErwin worries that the human pilot has escaped in the steam. When the Scouts are ordered to retreat, a cloaked figure approaches Squad Levi in the air, killing Gunther.",
    "Trusting in the abilities of his comrades, Eren retreats as Squad Levi attacks a newly transformed Female Titan. However, its abilities catch the Scouts off-guard before all are killed one by one. In a rage, Eren transforms into his Titan form to battle the monster himself.\nEren relentlessly assaults the Female Titan, but eventually he is defeated as Mikasa comes to his aid. Biting Eren out of his Titan's nape, the Female Titan retreats while Mikasa pursues it. Levi arrives afterward, joining Mikasa to pursue the Titan from a distance.",
    "Mikasa and Captain Levi pursue the Female Titan, deciding to rescue Eren and join in the retreat. Levi quickly overpowers the Female and rescues Eren, though he is injured in the process.\nThe retreating Scouts are pursued by Titans, leading them to reluctantly toss the corpses of their dead from the carriages. Returning to Calaneth in bitter defeat, the Scouts are later ordered to transport Eren to the capital.",
    "In Stohess District on eastern Wall Sina, Annie prepares to join her Military Police in a mission to escort Eren to the capital until she is pulled aside by Armin, who asks for her assistance in sneaking Eren away to safety. Hesitantly agreeing, Annie is led by Eren, Armin, and Mikasa to a tunnel leading underground.\nAnnie refuses to follow the Scouts below, and their suspicions that Annie is the Female Titan are confirmed. Escaping capture, Annie transforms in the middle of the city.",
    "Recalling the meeting when the Scouts suspect the Female Titan's identity, Eren is too hesitant to transform into his Titan to fight Annie. Devising a plan to distract her, Mikasa and Armin split up to confront Annie, but Eren is crushed under the collapsing tunnel.\nThe Scout Regiment engages in battle with the Female Titan while Jean and Armin attempt to convince Eren to fight. When Eren finally finds his resolve, he transforms into his Titan form and clashes with the Female Titan.",
    "The battle between Eren and Annie brings devastation to Stohess, leading up to a final struggle between the Titans near a damaged Wall Sina. Before she can be captured, Annie encases herself in a hardened crystal.\nWhile Eren and the Scouts recover, Commander Erwin answers to the mayor of the city for the chaos which ensued. Despite heavy losses and untold destruction, Erwin believes the capture of Annie Leonhart has brought humanity one step closer to understanding the true nature of the Titans.",
    "Hange interrogates Pastor Nick after discovering a Titan within the Wall, but gains no valuable information. 12 hours earlier, Titans are spotted southwards by Miche Zacharius, whilst watching suspect recruits. The soldiers ride out to warn civilians. Miche splits off to engage the spotted Titans alone.\nThe main Scout contingent is warned of the invasion. Miche kills 5 of the 9 Titans, and goes to leave. However, a beast-like Titan throws his horse at him, causing him to fall to the ground. He is questioned by the Beast, but stays silent. It takes his ODM gear, and has the nearby Titans eat Miche.",
    "The Scout Regiment set out for Ehrmich to assist in the crisis, bringing Pastor Nick with them to try to convince him to talk. On the way, Armin theorizes about the Wall Titans. Earlier, whilst riding to alert citizens, Sasha remembers her past with her father after the fall of Wall Maria.\nAt a village, Sasha saves a girl from a small Titan. She tells the child to run, and blinds the pursuing Titan to escape. She later reunites with her father, who had saved the child. Meanwhile, Conny arrives in his village, to see it in ruins. He rides to his house, but sees an immobile Titan laying atop it.",
    "Before the Scouts depart from Ragako, the Titan atop Conny's house welcomes him home. Later, Gelgar's and Nanaba's teams begin separately surveying the Wall for a breach. At night, the two Scout teams reunite, having found no breach in Wall Rose. They go to rest at Utgard castle.\nHange explains how Eren may be able to seal the breach, and Nick refuses to talk after seeing refugees, but reveals who can. At Utgard, Reiner confronts Ymir, but is interrupted when Titans are spotted outside. The veterans engage the Titans, and the Scouts under Hange ride for Utgard.",
    "At Utgard, the Scouts engage the Titans. Earlier, Reiner visits Ymir and realizes she is able to read an unknown writing. When the tower is breached, the recruits are left to halt the Titans advance. After a close call, they barricade a door.\nOutside, the Scouts nearly finish off the Titans, but the Beast Titan begins throwing projectiles at them, and calls in reinforcements. The veteran Scouts are killed, leaving the recruits defenseless and lamenting their deaths. Then, Ymir jumps from the castle, transforming into a Titan.",
    "In a 104th training exercise, the cadets notice that three people are missing. In the blizzard, Christa drags Daz through the snow. Ymir realizes that Christa is an illegitimate noble, and sends her ahead whilst she takes Daz. At the base, Christa finds the others had miraculously survived.\nAt Utgard, Ymir engages the Titans. During the fight, she tears down the tower, and rescues the other recruits. The Titans later emerge from the rubble, and begin to devour Ymir, until the Scouts arrive and cut them down. After the battle, Christa tells Ymir her real name - Historia.",
    "Atop Wall Rose, the Scouts prepare to regroup at Trost. Hange hopes for a co-operative future with Ymir, and Hannes admits they found no breach in the Wall. Reiner takes Eren aside, revealing his and Bertholdt's identities as the Armored and Colossal Titans, and requests Eren comes with them.\nAttempting to downplay his suspicion, Eren dismisses the claims, however, Reiner commits by regenerating a wound he sustained. He and Bertholdt are attacked by Mikasa, but manage to transform into their Titan forms, and grab Eren and Ymir. Betrayed, Eren transforms into his Titan.",
    "In his Titan form, Eren battles the Armored Titan while the Scout Regiment attacks the Colossal Titan. However, a whirlwind of steam coming from Bertholdt's Titan prevents them from coming close. Meanwhile, Eren is hopelessly overpowered until he recalls a special fighting technique he learned from Annie years ago. He gains the upper hand with Annie's maneuver, but a devastating interference from the Colossal Titan brings the fight to a sudden halt.",
    "Facing defeat at the hands of the Colossal Titan, Eren is taken away by Reiner and Bertholdt. Word is sent to Commander Pyxis in Trost of the situation in Wall Rose, and Commander Erwin gathers Scout Regiment and Military Police reinforcements to assist in the crisis.\nAt Wall Rose, Hannes comforts Mikasa and Armin, choosing to join them when the time comes to rescue Eren. When Erwin's reinforcements arrive, Hange theorizes on the traitors' new location, and the Scouts and MPs embark on a search for Eren and head for a Forest of Giant Trees.",
    "While the Scouts advance towards the Forest of Giant Trees, Eren and Ymir attempt to get answers from Reiner and Bertholdt. While receiving few answers, they discover that Reiner's personality has split under the pressure from living for two different goals.\nWhile Ymir wonders about the Warriors' goal and the reason for the Beast Titan's presence, Eren expresses his rage towards the traitors. The true enemy of humanity remains a mystery to Eren, though the Scouts are closing in on the forest with the intent of saving him from his fate.",
    "While Moblit makes a shocking discovery in Ragako, Erwin's scouting formation nears the Forest of Giant Trees. The Warriors make their escape, but Ymir desires to see Christa again.\nSeeing similarities in Christa's past and her own, Ymir refuses to cooperate with Reiner and Bertholdt until they agree to take Christa with them. The soldiers arrive shortly afterward, coming across Ymir's Titan. When Christa is captured by Ymir, the soldiers immediately begin pursuit.",
    "After hearing Ymir's motives, Historia agrees to stay by her side. The pursuing soldiers close in on the Armored Titan and corner Bertholdt, who refuses to give up Eren. Erwin leads a hellish charge against the Warriors in which he is injured, though Eren is rescued. Reiner refuses to let him escape and begins throwing Titans into the retreating formation. When Eren and Mikasa are dismounted in the chaos, they come across the Titan that ate Eren's mother five years ago.",

She saw her father, Rod Reiss, for the first time when he came to see her after Wall Maria fell, but men in black coats intervened before he could take her away. Rod had them spare Historia under the condition that she live a quiet life far away under the name 'Christa Lenz.' In the present day, Rod apologizes for that and informs Historia that she has royal blood and is the only person who can save humanity.\nMeanwhile, Erwin meets Pyxis and discusses the overthrow of the government.

Though Dot Pyxis calls for an evacuation of the civilians in Wall Rose, the nobles override his order and demand that the gates to Wall Sina be closed.

However, Historia realizes that inheriting the Founding Titan will not save anyone because even if her sister had the power to eradicate all the Titans, there is something about inheriting the power that prevents people from using it. She chooses to shatter the syringe and works to free Eren, but her father laps up the remaining fluid and transforms into a Titan.",

Eren wallows in despair, but his friends refuse to give up, causing him to take a chance and use a bottle labeled 'Armor' that he spots on the ground. Ingesting its contents allow him to use a new hardening ability with his Titan that stabilizes the cavern around his comrades so they can survive.\nSquad Levi meets up with Erwin Smith and the rest of the Scout Regiment outside. Rod's Titan is twice the size of the Colossal Titan and they cannot fight it conventionally. They rush to Orvud District where they will make a stand.

Its face has been scraped away by the ground while it was dragging itself. The Scouts take over the Wall's defense and shoot the gunpowder-laden carts into the Titan's hands, which explode, causing it to lose its grip. The Titan slumps over the Wall and Eren charges forward in his Titan form to shove the sack of gunpowder into its gaping mouth.

The two became friends, and Grisha inspired Keith to think he was special. However, Keith suffered many failures, both in his personal life and as an officer, and came to realize he was not special at all. He was with Grisha the night Wall Maria fell, and carried Eren out of the woods after Grisha had taken him there. Keith hoped that Eren would avoid becoming like his father, but even though he sabotaged Eren's training gear when he was a cadet, Eren would not give up.

    "Zeke Jaeger recalls his childhood and how he was forced to become part of his parents' plan to free Eldia from Marley. He becomes friends with Tom Xaver, a member of the Titan research team and vows to inherit the Beast Titan from him. He goes on to say he will ensure the success of the plan to take back the Founding Titan. After recalling his memories, Zeke triggers the Thunder Spear, detonating it and catching Levi Ackermann by surprise.",
    "Floch Forster, Hange Zoë, and a number of Jaegerists are traveling to a Forest of Giant Trees when they hear the explosion caused by Zeke Jaeger triggering a Thunder Spear. As Zeke succumbs to his wounds, a Titan crawls up to him and tears open its belly, stuffing his body inside.\nMeanwhile, Yelena has Dot Pyxis and other dissenting members of the military assembled in Shiganshina District. Eren Jaeger goes to meet with the imprisoned Gabi Braun, to have her send out a distress call to Marley in exchange for saving Falco Grice. However, a disguised Pieck approaches Eren and claims she wishes to help him destroy Marley. As a proof of her intentions, she offers to show Eren the location of her fellow spies in Paradis Island.",
    "The Marleyan invasion of Shiganshina District begins in earnest. Porco Galliard, Pieck Finger, and Gabi Braun escape their rooftop confrontation with Eren Jaeger and meet up with General Theo Magath who has brought a fleet of airships and army of soldiers with him. They outfit Pieck's Cart Titan as a mobile artillery platform in order to take down Eren's Founding Titan. Because he has not used its power yet, they suspect he can only do so when united with Zeke Jaeger.\nEren fights along with the Jaegerists against the Marleyans, but is gradually overwhelmed between the opposing Titans and the constant shelling. Onyankopon fears that he will ultimately lose and be eaten. He runs to free Eren's friends, who have been imprisoned inside their own military headquarters, but is greeted with skepticism. They would like to stop the invasion, but helping Eren also means supporting the euthanization plan they do not approve of. Armin Arlelt tries suggesting that Eren is only appearing to cooperate with Yelena in order to keep her in line, but his words are met with silence.",
    "Eren Jaeger is granted a reprieve by the timely arrival of his older brother Zeke, who begins fending off the other Titans attacking him as well as assaulting the Marleyan airships up above. After some coercion, the previously imprisoned soldiers who did not cooperate with the Jaegerists are freed so they can help defend Paradis Island. Those who have not drunk the wine tainted by Zeke's spinal fluid are given omni-directional mobility gear and the remainder organize on foot under Dot Pyxis. Reinforcing Eren proves difficult however, and a ruse from Pieck Finger and Theo Magath give them a free shot with their artillery at Zeke, knocking his Beast Titan off of Wall Maria.\nWhen Falco Grice leaves the headquarters along with the formerly imprisoned soldiers, he spots his brother Colt. Nile Dawk reunites the two under the pretense of restraining Falco in a house, and the brothers leave along with Gabi Braun, who finally realizes that there are no devils on the island, just people. She apologizes to Falco for getting him involved, which prompts him to confess his feelings for her, since he is afraid he could turn into a Titan soon. On hearing that Falco drank the spinal fluid, Colt rushes them to Zeke, hoping that he will not scream if Falco is among the afflicted.",
    "Colt Grice pleads with Zeke Jaeger to not use the Beast Titan's scream so his brother Falco is not transformed into a Titan. Zeke understands and likens Colt' s care for Falco to his care for Eren. Unfortunately, he proceeds to transform not just Falco, but every soldier in Shiganshina District who drank his spinal fluid. The Titans begin attacking the invading Marleyan military and Zeke commands the newly transformed Falco to attack Reiner Braun and free his own brother, Eren.\nZeke is shot through the nape by Theo Magath and his artillery crew, but survives by playing dead and allowing his Beast Titan to dissolve. Realizing this, Eren traps Reiner by grabbing him and hardening his Titan, while escaping out the nape. He runs on foot to join Zeke, but is decapitated by Gabi Braun, who shoots him through the neck with a high-caliber, anti-Titan rifle. Eren wakes in the Paths with Zeke, who explains that this is where the royal family would command their ancestor Ymir to do their bidding. When Eren refuses to go along with the Eldian euthanasia plan, Zeke vows to use her power to force Eren see things his way.",
    "Zeke and Eren Jaeger travel through their father Grisha's memories as Zeke attempts to show Eren that Grisha only cared about him as a tool. However, he instead sees Grisha giving Eren freedom that Zeke never had as a child. Eren's determination and willingness to fight for his freedom are things he has always had on his own. When Grisha reacts to their presence in his memories, Zeke is surprised that Grisha has not forgotten about him.\nThe day Wall Maria falls, they see Grisha confront Frieda Reiss in the underground chapel. Due to the vow to renounce war, she refuses to save the people of Wall Maria and insists the Eldians atone for their ancestors' crimes by accepting the world's hatred of them. Grisha reveals that he was led here by future memories he received through the Attack Titan. He plans to kill her to obtain the Founding Titan and end the royal bloodline, but falters because he does not want to murder children. Eren intervenes, and using the fact Grisha can hear him through his future memories, convinces Grisha to go ahead with the attack. Following the massacre, Grisha apologizes to Zeke, saying he was a terrible father, and asks him to stop Eren.",
    "Zeke Jaeger is pushed out of Grisha's memories after learning that Eren manipulated their father into taking the Founding Titan from the King of the Walls. However, Zeke realizes that Eren's ability to see the future has limitations, so he orders Ymir Fritz to remove the ability of all Eldians to reproduce.

After the fighting dies down, the Braus family takes her to meet Armin and Mikasa. She explains her intent to find Falco and then leave, but is horrified to learn of Conny's plans. Gabi pleads with Armin to talk with Eren so everyone outside the island does not have to die, asking that he hit specific targets like he undid the Armored Titan's hardening. On hearing this, Armin realizes that all Titan hardening has been undone, not just the Walls', which means that Annie Leonhart is now free.Zeke Jaeger is pushed out of Grisha's memories after learning that Eren manipulated their father into taking the Founding Titan from the King of the Walls.

    "Hitch Dreyse unexpectedly reunites with Annie Leonhart and helps her escape the ruins of Trost District following the collapse of the Walls and the march of the Wall Titans. Annie explains the complex feelings that brought her this far and how the one thing she wants to do now is reunite with her father.

Realizing that Armin means to sacrifice himself instead, Conny drops Falco to save Armin and the two reconcile with Conny resolving to save others and become a soldier his mother would be proud of.\nBack in Shiganshina District, Floch Forster begins the execution proceedings for Yelena and Onyankopon, and reads out their crimes against the Eldian Empire. Onyankopon tries appealing to Jean Kirschtein for understanding, and Jean takes out a gun, firing four times. This turns out to be a signal and the Cart Titan charges in and escapes after snatching Jean and the captives in its mouth. At the same time the Jaegerist soldiers are distracted by the Cart Titan, Armin and his group escape out the other side of the fort, taking wagons of supplies with them.",
    "The portion of the Scout Regiment still led by Hange Zoë shares an uneasy campfire with Theo Magath and the remaining Warriors. The two sides are suspicious of each other given their respective histories and Annie Leonhart's skepticism that Eren Jaeger's friends will be able to kill him in the event that diplomacy fails. Yelena tries to fan the flames of that division, but largely fails until she brings up the death of Marco Bodt.\nReiner Braun takes responsibility for that, but overemphasizes his feelings of guilt to Jean Kirschtein, who does not want to hear how awful Reiner feels about it. He begins to beat down Reiner, only to hit Gabi Braun by accident when she tries to protect her cousin. Gabi understands that Jean has good reasons for hating the Warriors, but pleads with him to help save her family in Liberio. Though he needs time to cool off, Jean agrees and the combined group heads towards the port where they expect to find a flying boat they can use to chase after Eren.",
    "The combined forces of Hange Zoë's remaining Scouts and Theo Magath's remaining Warriors plan on escaping Paradis Island on the flying boat, which is kept in the Jaegerist occupied port. In order to do this, they need to prevent the flying boat's destruction by the Jaegerists and rescue the Azumabito family who are the only ones capable of servicing the aircraft.\nArmin Arlelt and Conny Springer attempt this through a peaceful deception, pretending to need the flying boat in order to chase after the Cart and Armored Titans, but when Floch Forster decides it would be safer to eliminate the Azumabito, the combined group is forced into a battle. The Azumabito are guided to the basement by Mikasa Ackermann and others, where they can be protected while Annie Leonhart and Reiner Braun use their Titans to fight the Jaegerists. At the dock, Conny is forced to kill Daz and Samuel Linke-Jackson in order to save Armin's life and prevent the destruction of the flying boat.",
    "Upon learning that the Azumabito mechanics need a minimum of half a day in order to prepare the flying boat for take off, Theo Magath agrees to Kiyomi Azumbabito's suggestion that they escape the port on the Azumabito ship and tow the flying boat with them to Odiha in Marley where her family has a hangar. Though Liberio will be lost to the delay, Odiha is far enough away that they should arrive before the rumbling.\nHange Zoë and Magath's combined forces manage to repel the Jaegerists long enough for everyone to board the ship, though they are briefly delayed by the rampage of Falco Grice's first transformation as the Jaw Titan. After seeing everyone on board, Magath orders Onyankopon to set sail while he stays behind. Together with Keith Sadies, Magath boards a captured Marleyan cruiser capable of catching up to the Azumabito ship. He and Keith exchange words of mutual respect before blowing up the ship's magazine and sinking the cruiser.",
    "Mikasa Ackermann recalls the Scout Regiment's first trip to Marley, where they had joyful moments such as discovering ice cream and connecting with refugees from the Marley Mid-East War, but also disappointments, in that the Subjects of Ymir Protection Group was not the ally the Scouts hoped they would be. That was when Eren Jaeger left the Scouts and began operating on his own, telling them that he would follow his brother Zeke's plan. Mikasa wonders if they could have made choices so things would have turned out differently.\nMeanwhile, Eren recalls the events that had led him here; how he had met Yelena and learned of Zeke's euthanasia plan, how he had confided in Floch Forster that he would only pretend to go along with Zeke's plan when in reality he would use the rumbling to wipe out the rest of the world, and how he had tried and failed to persuade Historia Reiss to fight or flee before the Military Police turned her into a Titan to eat Zeke. A fleet of ships tries to stop Eren's army of Wall Titans, but fails, and his Titans finally arrive at Marley's shores.",
    "The march of Eren Jaeger and the Wall Titans reaches the Marleyan city of Liberio, killing most of its people, though some survivors escape. Eren has known since he first arrived in Marley that he would one day flatten this city, and feels trapped by a future he cannot change because to behave differently would not be in his nature. Despite this, he calls his friends into the Paths in order to tell them that there can be no compromise so long as their stances are unwavering. The only thing left is for them to fight.\nThe combined group of surviving Scouts and Warriors manage to get the flying boat fueled and prepared at Odiha, but not without a costly delay caused by Floch Forster. Hange Zoë fights the approaching Titans alone to buy the group time, handing command over to Armin Arlelt.

Following a failed bombing run by the Marleyan military, the Scouts and Warriors jump from the flying boat and on to the back of Eren's Founding Titan.",
