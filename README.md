This Project provides characters, episodes, locations, Organizations & titans information from a popular manga __Attack On Titan__ , written by Hajime Isayama.



## Design Process
My intention for the design of this app was to make it look cinematic and like anime style. To achieve this, I searched the design ideas from [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/sg/title/70299043) for the Hero section. The titan display part i searched design from [Naruto website](https://naruto-official.com/en/special/naruto-storm-series), for the Song page i adapt the design from __Spotify__.
