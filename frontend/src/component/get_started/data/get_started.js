            On the side of the wall.. there is a sea.
            On the side of the sea.. is freedom.
            That is what i always believed.
            But i was wrong.
            On the other side of the sea... are enemies.
            Every part of this is exactly how i saw  in dad's memories.
            Hey...If we kill all our enemies over there...will we finally.. be free?

            True, I saw everyone on the other side of the sea as my enemy.
            But then, i crossed the sea, slept under the same roof as them, ate the same food...
            Reiner, i am the same as you.
            There are jerks here, but good people too.
            Across the sea, within the walls... it is the same.
            But u guys taught everyone in the walls was a devil.
            You were children who knew nothing, but was drilled into you. You were just kids. What could you even do?
            Right Reiner? Hasn't that been eating away you?
            I will keep moving forward until i destroy my enemies.

            To all Subjects of Ymir. My name is Eren Yeager. I'm using the power of the founding titan to address all subjects of Ymir. I have undone the hardening of all the walls in Paradis island, and all Titans entrapped within them have started marching. My goal is to protect the people of Paradis, the place I was born and raised. However, the world wishes for the annihilation of the people of Paradis. Not just the people of this island,  but until all of the Subjects of Ymir have been eliminated. I reject that wish. The Wall Titans shall trample all surface of the land outside of this island. Until all lives existing there have been exterminated from this world.
